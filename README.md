Filmmaker Portfolio developed by Kurt Reti for Issak Hindson.

The site was built using Next.js alongside additional react libaries.

The site went through several design iterations in Figma before a final single page design was reached. Next.js was decided upon for the library in order to make use of the Next image component and the sharp library for high resolution photos to load without delay.
